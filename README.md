<h2 align="center">Hello there, my name is Nikola PaunoviÄ‡!&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ’»&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="31px"></h2>

<p align="center">Welcome to my Github page. My passion for technology and solving real-world problems has evolved into a serious professional path that blends programming, media, and entrepreneurship. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing two master's programs â€“ one in Software Engineering and another in International Business and Management. Flutter is my primary tool, but I always trying to see broader picture: backend logic, user experience, and marketing strategy. I've been both a team leader and a student. I'm the founder of my own company with projects spanning mobile development, television, and digital marketing. </p>
